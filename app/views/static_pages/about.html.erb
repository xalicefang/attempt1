    <p>
      Alice was born on a fine spring day in October in the year 1999. It may have raining, or it may have not, depending on your definition of rain and your interpretation of may. In her early years, Alice was a stereotypical Asian girl who enjoyed encouraging dandelion proliferation, smiling, and ballet. As she grew older, her interests became more varied and complex as she took up bobbing, quacking, violin-ing, ice creaming, and laughing. Alice has a very distinct laugh that has been likened to "a seagull on crack". When she speaks formally, her voice loses its usual squawkiness and rises a few octaves. Alice is engaged to Feo and thus is already taken for prom (sorry). Alice also enjoys inventing sound effects, drawing the back of Anson’s head, comparing people to animals/vegetables/fruit/minerals/proteins, being a dictator, and pretending to be a monster. She loves ice cream more than any other edible substance, except perhaps MSG. For her birthday this year, she would like three gallons of ice cream (any flavor), a year’s worth of MSG noodles, and a chemistry textbook. When she’s not making her own fan pages or stalking people, she engages in a variety of philanthropic activities. Thanks to Alice, a child will have food for half a day. Alice is known by some of her peers as Shrubbery, Bean Sprout, or Male Frog. Alice loves math, but math loves her more.
